# MyWebsite

This repository contains the source code for my personal website! It is designed to showcase my educational background, accomplishments, projects, and hobbies. Planning to build using HTML and CSS only for now. This website provides a comprehensive overview of my experiences and interests. It's intended for anyone seeking to learn more about me!
